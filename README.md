# MGM Packing Assistant

A comprehensive order management and packing calculation system designed for small-scale food manufacturing units that produce sausages, burgers, and similar products. The application streamlines the process of calculating packing requirements based on customer orders.

## 🎯 Overview

The MGM Packing Assistant helps manufacturing units:
- Manage customer information and their specific packing preferences
- Create and track orders with automatic packing calculations
- Calculate the number of trays, tubs, and boxes needed for each order
- Apply customer-specific packing rules and rounding logic
- Track order status from creation to completion

## ✨ Features

### Customer Management
- Add and manage customer profiles
- Set default pack types (tray or tub) per customer
- Configure special packing instructions for each customer
- Define regular product lists for quick order creation

### Order Creation
- Select from predefined regular items based on customer preferences
- Add additional products on-demand
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Number of trays or tubs based on product weight
  - Number of boxes based on packing rules
  - Total weight per order
- Support for different tub sizes (2kg and 5kg)
- Per-item pack type selection (tray/tub)

### Packing Calculations
- **Tray Packing**: Products packed in 400g trays, with configurable trays per box
- **Tub Packing**: Products packed in 2kg or 5kg tubs, with configurable tubs per box
- **Burger Packing**: Special calculations for burger products (typically 12 per tray)
- **Meatball Packing**: Count-based packing (configurable count per tub)
- **Rounding Rules**: Support for rounding up, down, or to specific multiples
- **No-Box Option**: Some customers may prefer loose trays without boxing

### Order Management
- View complete order history
- Filter orders by date or status
- Order status tracking:
  - **Draft**: Order being prepared
  - **Confirmed**: Order confirmed for production
  - **Completed**: Order delivered
  - **Cancelled**: Order cancelled
- View detailed order breakdown including all items and calculations

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Creating a New Order

1. Navigate to **New Order** from the home page
2. Select a customer from the dropdown
3. The system automatically loads the customer's regular products
4. Enter quantities for each product (in kg, count, or trays depending on product type)
5. Toggle between tray/tub pack types if applicable
6. For products with size options (2kg/5kg tubs), select the appropriate size
7. Use **Add Other Item** to include additional products not in the regular list
8. Review the calculated trays/tubs and boxes
9. Click **Save Order** to confirm


## ⚙️ Configuration

### Customer Rules

Customer-specific packing rules can be configured in `apps/web/src/store/index.ts`:

```typescript
{
  customerId: 'customer-id',
  customerName: 'Customer Name',
  regularProducts: [
    { productId: 'chicken-sausage', packType: 'tray' },
    { productId: 'beef-burger', packType: 'tray' }
  ],
  packingRules: {
    traysPerBox: 20,           // Number of trays per box
    tubsPerBox5kg: 3,          // Number of 5kg tubs per box
    tubsPerBox2kg: 7,          // Number of 2kg tubs per box
    roundingRule: 'down',      // 'up', 'down', or 'nearest'
    roundToMultiple: 20,       // Round to multiple of this number
    noBoxes: false,            // If true, don't calculate boxes
    extraTubRule: 'pack4'      // Special rule for extra tubs
  },
  specialInstructions: 'Customer-specific notes'
}
```

### Product Configuration

Products are defined in the `ALL_PRODUCTS` array:

```typescript
{
  id: 'product-id',
  name: 'Product Name',
  category: 'sausage',        // 'sausage', 'burger', or 'meatball'
  weightPerTray: 0.4,         // Weight in kg per tray
  weightPerTub: 5,            // Weight in kg per tub (for tub products)
  traysPerBox: 25,            // Default trays per box
  tubsPerBox: 3,              // Default tubs per box
  defaultPackType: 'tray'     // 'tray' or 'tub'
}
```

## 📊 Calculation Logic

### Tray Calculations
- **Trays Needed** = Order Weight (kg) ÷ Weight per Tray (typically 0.4kg)
- **Boxes Needed** = Trays Needed ÷ Trays per Box

### Tub Calculations
- **Tubs Needed** = Order Weight (kg) ÷ Tub Size (2kg or 5kg)
- **Boxes Needed** = Tubs Needed ÷ Tubs per Box

### Rounding Rules
- **Round Up**: Always round to the next whole number
- **Round Down**: Always round to the lower whole number
- **Round to Multiple**: Round to nearest multiple (e.g., multiples of 20)

### Special Cases
- **Meatballs**: Calculated by count rather than weight
- **No-Box Customers**: Trays/tubs delivered without boxing
- **Extra Tub Rule**: Special handling for remaining tubs that don't fill a complete box

2. Go to **Application** → **Local Storage**
3. Delete the `mgm-packing-store` entry
4. Refresh the page
